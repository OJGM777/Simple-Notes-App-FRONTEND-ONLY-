# Simple-Notes-App (FRONTEND ONLY)
This is a Note app that includes a note section and a Tasks section.

!!!!THE PORPUSE OF THIS EARLY VERSION IS TO GIVE A SIMPLER CRUD APP IN CASE THAT SOMEONE WANTS TO DOWNLOAD IT AS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND NOT DO AND ALSO REFLECT MY HISTORY AND (MAYBE) IMPROVEMENT AS A DEVELOPER.!!!!

<b>This Web APP was made in "Mobile First", so the responsive and appearance is prioritized for Mobile devices.</b>

This version of the Notes App only has all the Frontend code, it means that this repository does not have any kind of code related to the backend, everything in this Repo is only pure front-end;
There will be another version of this app with new tecnologies and features as:

<ul>
  <li>BACKEND FUNCTIONS</li>
  <li>COLLABORATIVE LISTS</li>
  <li>PROFILES</li>
</ul>

This version is completely functional, but the main way of storage is the LocalStorage from the browser because the main purpose is to create a simple Note app with CRUD.
This much simplier version has this features:

<ul>
  <li>COMPLETELY RESPONSIVE</li>
  <li>BASIC CRUD OPERATIONS</li>
  <li>FOLDER MANAGEMENT</li>
  <li>BASIC NOTES MANAGEMENT</li>
  <li>BASIC TASKS MANAGEMENT</li>
</ul>

The main tecnologies and libraries used in this version are:

<ul>
  <li>FRAMER MOTION (FOR ANIMATIONS)</li>
  <li>uuid (to create id's on a simpler way)</li>
  <li>TAILWIND CSS</li>
  <li>MOMENT (for Dates)</li>
  <li>REACT ICONS</li>
</ul>

In this project i wanted to try some new libraries, that's why i was using FRAMER MOTION, so this is my first time using this Library. I wanted to simplify the process of adding animation as fast as possible so that's why i choose this library.

(IF YOU FOUND ANY BUG OR PROBLEM WITH THE USAGE OF THIS LIBRARY PLEASE LET ME KNOW I WILL BE GLAD TO READ YOU ;) )

This Version also has a Settings window where you can change the font and toggle the view (light and dark mode).

There is also a section where you can find all your checked tasks in case that you want to return one of them to the pending tasks section.

The folders section let's you change the name of the folder, create it or delete it.
